## Film Query Project

### Week 6 homework for Skill Distillery.

## Overview: Film Query

Assignment Guidelines:

Build a platform with a search function that allows the user to search through a database of 1000 films. Upon starting the program, the user is prompted with a menu to search for information on a film by entering either a film ID, or keyword which searches through the titles and descriptions of each movie in the database. When a film is displayed, the program shows the films title, release year, rating, language, description, and cast. 



## Lessons Learned

Personally I learned through building this project about databases and utilizing the data. How to pull and connect data from tables to show in unique and personalized ways. Getting hands on experience helped me better understand the concepts learned in class the week prior about mySQL. I look forward to expanding my understanding of utilizing databases. 

Technically I got experience reading through tables in MySQL figuring out how to pull information from different tables and utilizing methods to call upon that data to be displayed based on user input. One challenge I faced was connecting a list of all the actors within a film by comparing film IDs.
